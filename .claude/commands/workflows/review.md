If no review_target is given, check out the current feature branch using Git and use that as the basis for your review.

<critical_requirement> MUST create worktree FIRST to enable local code analysis. No exceptions. </critical_requirement>

<thinking>
First, I need to determine the review target type and set up the worktree.
This enables all subsequent agents to analyze actual code, not just diffs.
</thinking>

#### Immediate Actions:

<task_list>

- [ ] Determine review type: PR number (numeric), GitHub URL, file path (.md), or empty (latest PR)
- [ ] Create worktree directory structure at `$git_root/.worktrees/reviews/pr-$identifier`
- [ ] Check out PR branch in isolated worktree using `gh pr checkout`
- [ ] Navigate to worktree - ALL subsequent analysis happens here
- [ ] Install dependencies (`npm install` or equivalent) for deep analysis </task_list>

#### Parallel Subtasks:

<parallel_tasks>

- Fetch PR metadata using `gh pr view --json` for title, body, files, linked issues
- Clone PR branch into worktree with full history

- Can any complex logic be simplified?
- Are there redundant checks or validations?
- Can any abstractions be removed without loss of clarity?
- Are all features actually required?

#### Minimalism Checklist:

- [ ] Simplify complex conditionals
- [ ] Remove unused imports and variables
- [ ] Consolidate similar functions
- [ ] Question every abstraction layer
- [ ] Reduce configuration options to essentials
- [ ] Remove "just in case" code
- [ ] Simplify data structures where possible
- [ ] Eliminate premature optimizations

#### Conciseness Review:

- [ ] Can any multi-line expressions be simplified?
- [ ] Are there verbose patterns that can be more idiomatic?
- [ ] Can error messages be more concise while remaining clear?
- [ ] Is the documentation unnecessarily verbose?
- [ ] Can test cases be combined without losing coverage?

#### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) Analysis:

- [ ] Remove features not currently needed
- [ ] Eliminate extensibility points without clear use cases
- [ ] Question generic solutions for specific problems
- [ ] Remove configuration for unlikely scenarios
- [ ] Simplify APIs to match actual usage

#### Final Simplification Actions:

```bash
# Generate simplification report
claude-code "
Review all changes for opportunities to simplify:
1. Identify overly complex implementations
2. Find redundant code patterns
3. Suggest more minimal alternatives
4. Highlight unnecessary abstractions
5. Recommend what can be removed
" --worktree "$worktree_path"

# Create minimalism recommendations
echo "## Simplification Opportunities" > simplification.md
echo "### Code that can be removed:" >> simplification.md
echo "### Patterns that can be simplified:" >> simplification.md
echo "### Abstractions to reconsider:" >> simplification.md
```

## Execution Workflow

<workflow_overview> A systematic 8-phase approach ensuring thorough review coverage. Each phase builds on the previous, with clear success criteria. </workflow_overview>

### Phase 1: Immediate Worktree Setup and Checkout

<critical_first_step> THIS MUST HAPPEN FIRST. No exceptions. All analysis depends on local code access. </critical_first_step>

<step_by_step_commands>

```bash
# Step 1: Capture review target
review_target="${1:-$(gh pr list --limit 1 --json number --jq '.[0].number')}"
echo "Reviewing: $review_target"

# Step 2: Validate git repository
git_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: Not in a git repository"
    exit 1
fi

# Step 3: Determine review type
if [[ "$review_target" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    pr_identifier="$review_target"
    review_type="pr"
elif [[ "$review_target" =~ github\.com/.*/pull/([0-9]+) ]]; then
    pr_identifier="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
    review_type="pr"
elif [[ -f "$review_target" ]]; then
    review_type="document"
    doc_path="$review_target"
else
    echo "Error: Invalid review target"
    exit 1
fi

# Step 4: Create worktree for PR reviews
if [ "$review_type" = "pr" ]; then
    worktree_base="$git_root/.worktrees/reviews"
    worktree_path="$worktree_base/pr-$pr_identifier-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

    mkdir -p "$worktree_base"

    # Fetch PR metadata
    pr_data=$(gh pr view $pr_identifier --json title,author,baseRefName,headRefName)
    pr_branch=$(echo "$pr_data" | jq -r '.headRefName')

    # Create worktree with PR branch
    git fetch origin "pull/$pr_identifier/head:pr-$pr_identifier"
    git worktree add "$worktree_path" "pr-$pr_identifier"

    # Navigate to worktree - CRITICAL
    cd "$worktree_path"
    echo "Working in: $worktree_path"

    # Install dependencies
    if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
        npm install --silent
    elif [ -f "requirements.txt" ]; then
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    elif [ -f "Gemfile" ]; then
        bundle install
    fi
fi
```

</step_by_step_commands>

  find . -name "*.test.*" -type f
) &

wait  # Wait for all parallel jobs
```

### Phase 3: Deep Multi-Agent Analysis

Launch all analysis agents in parallel with specific focus areas:

```bash
# Create analysis directories
mkdir -p analysis/{architecture,security,performance,quality,integration}

# Launch parallel analysis agents
parallel --jobs 10 << 'EOF'
analyze_architecture.sh > analysis/architecture/report.md
analyze_security.sh > analysis/security/report.md
analyze_performance.sh > analysis/performance/report.md
analyze_quality.sh > analysis/quality/report.md
analyze_integration.sh > analysis/integration/report.md
analyze_devops.sh > analysis/devops/report.md
analyze_data.sh > analysis/data/report.md
analyze_ux.sh > analysis/ux/report.md
analyze_debt.sh > analysis/debt/report.md
analyze_testing.sh > analysis/testing/report.md
EOF
```

### Phase 4: Ultra-Thinking Synthesis

  --body-file final_review.md \
  --comment

# Add inline code comments
gh pr comment $pr_identifier \
  --body-file analysis/code_comments.md

# Create follow-up issues if needed
create_github_issues.sh analysis/action_plan.md
```

### Phase 8: Knowledge Preservation

```bash
# Archive review artifacts
tar -czf "reviews/pr-$pr_identifier-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz" \
  analysis/ reports/ final_review.md

# Update team knowledge base
